## üìÉ Overview
This project is a RESTful API designed for forum management. The use cases are centered around the fundamental elements of __questions__, __answers__, and __comments__. The entire application is built following SOLID principles, clean architecture, and domain event patterns.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Getting started

**Requirements**
- [Node.js - Official Node.js¬Æ download page](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
- [Docker Engine - Official Docker installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install)
- [AWS CLI - Official AWS CLI installation page](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)
- [Terraform - Official Terraform installation guide](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/aws-get-started/install-cli)

**Clone the project**
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/wladimirgrf/forum.git && cd forum
```

**Install the Project dependencies**
```bash
$ npm install
```

**Environment Variables**
```bash
$ cp .env.example .env
```

**Set access credentials**
```bash
aws configure
```

## üñ•Ô∏è Local Environment

**Run the containers**
```bash
$ docker-compose up -d
```

**Migrations**
```bash
$ npm run db:migrate
```

**Launch the Application**
```bash
$ npm run start:dev
```
>[!NOTE]
>The API will be launched at `http://localhost:3333/` <br>
>Documentation available at `http://localhost:3333/docs`

## üöÄ Deployment
You need to set up the resources for Terraform state synchronization.

**Create the Bucket**
```bash
aws s3api create-bucket --bucket forum-tf-state --region us-east-1
```

>[!CAUTION]
>S3 requires unique names for buckets.

**Create the DynamoDB table for state lock**
```bash
aws dynamodb create-table \
    --table-name forum-tf-state-lock \
    --attribute-definitions AttributeName=LockID,AttributeType=S \
    --key-schema AttributeName=LockID,KeyType=HASH \
    --provisioned-throughput ReadCapacityUnits=1,WriteCapacityUnits=1 \
    --region us-east-1
```

**Initialize the Working Directory**
```bash
npm run infra:prep
```

**Check the Execution Plan (_OPTIONAL_)**
```bash
npm run infra:plan
```

**Deploy the entire Infrastructure**
```bash
# The process takes about 10 minutes
npm run infra:up
```

>[!NOTE]
>Terraform requires a username and password for database access during deployment to securely connect the application.

## ‚ñ≥ Prisma
__Prisma migrations are automatically executed during deployment.__

However, a point of attention is that this project uses private VPC and that Prisma does not support (_in the current version_) the execution of migrations via API. 

In this case, I downloaded the engine of the current version that I am using into the project's deployment flow, and with a simple JS script, it is possible to use Lambda to execute the migrations within the VPC.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>So, if you want to run this project or another with the same structure, you need to pay attention to the engine version. Below is the link with the step-by-step guide to download the schema engine for the version of Prisma you are using:
> https://github.com/prisma/prisma/discussions/14873

Another link that is interesting to follow is the issue that addresses this topic in the Prisma repository. This feature may eventually be supported by the framework.
